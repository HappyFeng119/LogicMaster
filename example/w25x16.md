#w25x16 spi flash

The W25X16 (16M-bit), W25X32 (32M-bit), and W25X64 (64M-bit) Serial Flash memories provide a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power. The 25X series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code download applications as well as storing voice, text and data. The devices operate on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 5mA active and 1Î¼A for power-down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages.

The W25X16/32/64 supports the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance dual output SPI using four pins: Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O and Serial Data Out. SPI clock frequencies of up to **75MHz** are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 150MHz when using the Fast Read Dual Output instruction. These transfer rates are comparable to those of 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories.

The W25X16/32/64 is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock
(CLK), Chip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input/Output (DIO) and Serial Data Output (DO). Both SPI bus
operation **Modes 0 (0,0)** and **3 (1,1)** are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and Mode
3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is not
being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 the CLK signal is normally low. For Mode 3 the CLK
signal is normally high. In either case data input on the DIO pin is sampled on the rising edge of the
CLK. Data on the DO and DIO pins are clocked out on the falling edge of CLK.
