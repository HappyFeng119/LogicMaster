#w25x16 spi flash chip

The W25X16 (16M-bit), W25X32 (32M-bit), and W25X64 (64M-bit) Serial Flash memories provide a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power. The 25X series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code download applications as well as storing voice, text and data. The devices operate on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 5mA active and 1Î¼A for power down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages.

*more informations about this chip please see it's datasheet*

0. before transfer any data by using spi,you should call *spi.init(mode,order,bauddiv)* first. After that,you can use spi.info getting spi configurations.

```lua
spi.init(spi.MODE3,spi.MSBFIRST)
spi.info()
```

1. read Manufacturer Device ID.

```lua
h=spi.HIGH
l=spi.LOW
first,second=spi.write(l,0x90,0x00,0x00,0x00,-2,h)
if first==0xEF then print("find winband flash chip") end
if second==0x14 then print("w25x16") 
elseif second==0x15 then print("w25x32")
elseif secont==0x16 then print("w25x64")
else print("unknow chip")
end
```
